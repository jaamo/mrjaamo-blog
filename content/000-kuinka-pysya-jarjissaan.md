- Max 2-3 meetings in a day is optimal for my introvert side. The more will be mentally burdening.
- Do not fill all tiny available time slots with work.
- Have breaks.
- List all (even ridiculously small) things to Trello and execute.
- If you got an idea during focus work write it to Trello and continue on current task.
- Someone somewhere is always unhappy for your performance. And something is always late. Accept that.
- We are not curing cancer.
